Bootcamp Final Project 
#  Predict home Prices

## Background
### Project Description
**Topic:** Predict home Prices

**Reason:** Real estate is a hot market right now and all group members were interested in seeing how various factors affect the value of a home in our area. The model and visualizations could be used to help a home buyer determine if the property they're interested in is accurately valued.

**Questions We Hope to Answer**
1. Does the rating of schools affect the home value? If so, how?
2. How does Prime Rate affect home value?
3. Are homes in the area being under- or over-valued?
