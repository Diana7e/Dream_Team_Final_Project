Home Price Calculator / Real Property Estimator
_Using machine learning model to predict home value._
An analysis of the effect of school ranking and primerate on the housing price in the Washington DC Metropoplitan area. 

Background
Shelter a key need in the span of every life can never be overemphasized. Whether it is starting a family, relocation or even investment choice, the dream of many to have a place to call their own.
Understanding the ins and outs of the Real Estate market and the entire home buying experince can often be a challenging task for most individuals on house hunt. 
With many factors being considered before landing on a home is interesting to know what factors culminate to the final price of a house in a particular area.
In a study conducted by Owusu-Edusei and Molly Espey in 2003, "high-ranked schools have values embedded in single-family housing prices and greater commuting distances to schools has a negative impact on the value of property".(Owusu-Edusei, Kwame and Molley Espey.  2003. “School Quality and Property Values in Greenville, South Carolina.” Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics, Clemson University. 30 January 2013.) 
It is in light of this conclusions from this and other research conducted that the team wants to undertake this project to identify whats parameters or key components that exist in the market and affect the cost or value of homes in the area.
The outcome of this project we also believe will provide a guide for future home buyers to estimate the real value of the property(s) they seek to acquire. 


Project Description
Topic: Predict home Prices

Reason: 
(Real estate is a hot market right now and all group members were interested in seeing how various factors affect the value of a home in our area. The model and visualizations could be used to help a home buyer determine if the property they're interested in is accurately valued.)

Questions We Hope to Answer

Does the rating of schools affect the home value? If so, how?
How does Prime Rate affect home value?
Are homes in the area being under- or over-valued?
